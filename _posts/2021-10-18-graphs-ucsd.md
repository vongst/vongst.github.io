### Learning Objectives

-   __Define graphs__
	+   Graphs represent a relationship between _pairs_ of objects. $$G = (V, E)$$, where
		*   $$V$$, non-empty set of vertices
		*   $$E$$, set of edges
-   Practice graph drawing
-   Identify graph classes
-   Decide whether a graph has an Eulerian cycle
-   Apply the degree sum formula
-   Determine connected components of a graph
-   Compute minimum spanning trees
-   Describe matchings in bipartite graphs
-   __Define planar graphs__
	+   Graph has a drawing where no 2 edges cross
-   Prove that planar graphs can be colored in 6 colors
-   Analyze Ramsey numbers
-   Review cliques, independent sets, and vertex covers
-   Define augmenting paths in networks
-   Compute maximim flows in graphs
-   Develop an algorithm for the stable matching problem

Display equation:

$$\int e^{-kx} \, dx = -\frac{1}{k} e^{-kx}$$

Some inline Latex: $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

- Empty graph
- Line graph 

#### Isomorphism

- must have the same number of vertices
- property of graph is preserved
- same up to a relabeling of vertices 
- computationally exhausting

#### Ways of representing graphs
1. adjacency matrix
2. adjacency list 
3. adjacency set
